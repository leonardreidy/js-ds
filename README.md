# js-ds

A simple Object-Oriented JavaScript data structures library in a broadly pseudoclassical style. 

## Installation

To use js-ds data structures in a project, include the corresponding source
files in the head of the html files of your project as needed. Currently, this 
project is a work-in-progress and data structure implementations will be added 
to the project as they are completed. Ultimately, the entire library will be
available to include in your project as a single source file ('js-ds.js').

## Usage

Usage follows fairly common object-oriented JavaScript patterns. To create and 
use a stack object, for example:

    var s = new Stack(); 	// create a new stack
    s.push("anElement"); 	// push a string onto the stack
    s.push(4);			 	// push a number onto the stack
    s.pop();			 	// pop an element off the stack
    s.peek();			 	// peek at the top element
    s.clear();			 	// clear the stack
    s.toString();		 	// get a string representation of the stack
