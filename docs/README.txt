To run jsdoc against an entire directory:

jsdoc -r [path]


To run it against a single file in the current directory:

jsdoc [filename]

To run it with a given configuration file:

jsdoc -c [/path/to/conf.json]

For my setup, I run it as follows from the project root directory:

jsdoc -c docs/conf.js
