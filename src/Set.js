/**
 * @class 
 * A <em>Set</em> is an unordered collection of unique elements. A set
 * with no elements is called the empty set. The universe is the set of all 
 * elements of interest (otherwise known as the universal set). Any two sets
 * are equal if and only if they contain precisely the same members. A set A 
 * is a subset of some set B if all of the members of A are also members of B. 
 * The basic operations on a set include union, intersection, and difference. 
 * The union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which belong to A 
 * or B, or both. The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of elements 
 * which belong to both A and B. The difference (symmetric difference) of two 
 * sets A and B includes those elements which belong to A or B but not to both.
 * A set <em>ADT</em> includes the following operations:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>insert</em>       - insert a new data element</li>
 * <li><em>remove</em>       - remove an existing data element</li>
 * <li><em>getSize</em>      - get the number of elements in the set</li>
 * <li><em>union</em>        - get the union of two sets</li>
 * <li><em>intersection</em> - get the intersection of two sets</li>
 * <li><em>subset</em>       - get a subset of a given set</li>
 * <li><em>difference</em>   - get the difference of two sets</li>
 * <li><em>toString</em>     - get a string representation of the set</li>
